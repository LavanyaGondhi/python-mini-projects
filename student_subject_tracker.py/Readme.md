Student Subject Tracker:
This is a beginner-level Python mini project created while learning Python.

📌 Description
This project tracks student subjects using Python data structures like
lists, tuples, and sets.
Each student has:
- A name and roll number (stored using a tuple)
- A set of subjects they attended (stored using a set)
The program performs various operations using loops and conditional logic.

🚀 Features
- Display student details (Name, Roll No, Subjects)
- Find all unique subjects in the class
- Find common subjects between two students
- Count number of subjects per student
- Identify student with maximum subjects
- Identify student with minimum subjects
- Show warning if a student attended fewer subjects
  
🧠 Concepts Used
- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- for loops
- if-else conditions
- Set operations (union, intersection)
- Logical comparison (min/max)

🎯 Purpose
This project was created to practice Python tuples and sets
and to improve logical thinking through small real-world examples.

✅ Status
